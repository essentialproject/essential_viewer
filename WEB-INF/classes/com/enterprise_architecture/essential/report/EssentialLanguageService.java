 * 25.06.2012	JWC	First implementation of shared Essential Language Service
 * 26.02.2013	JWC Updated to use a servlet-to-servlet forward rather than redirect to support
 * 					caching
 * 05.03.2013	JWC Back to the re-direct approach to ensure that the target page (after selecting
 * 					language) can be cached.
 * 03.07.2018	JWC Process the currentPageLink to plug open redirection vulnerability
 * 28.06.2019	JWC Added use of log4J

/**
 * REST-style Service Servlet to set the display language for Essential Viewer for the user that is
 * calling the service via an HTTP. Note that GET is also supported, although REST convention dictates that POST is preferred.
 * The service sets a user cookie to the selected IETF language flag (as recommended by W3C). 
 * Parameters supported by the service are as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>i18n - the selected IETF language flag, e.g. en-gb</li>
 * <li>currentPage - the URL of the current page that was being viewed when the language was selected. 
 * This is used by the EssentialLanguageService to return the user to that page once the language selection has
 * been recorded - and is then applied to the currentPage.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The service also uses Servlet Context parameters that are set in <tt>web.xml</tt>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>i18nCookieName - the name of the Cookie to set. REQUIRED</li>
 * <li>i18nDefault - the default IETF language selection. If no value is set by the user, this value will be used in the users' Cookie.</li>
 * <li>i18nCookieDomain - the domain value to be used by the Cookie. Can be used when hosting Essential Viewer across multiple
 * servers and you wish the users' language choice to apply across all Essential Viewer servers in a domain. Leave this empty if no domain setting is required. OPTIONAL</li>
 * <li>cookieTimeout - the time in seconds that the Cookie remains valid on the users' browser</li>
 * </ul>
